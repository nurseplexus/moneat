-- Governance for workflows: audit trail and per-execution usage accounting.
-- Audit events capture lifecycle and run transitions for the workflows surface.
-- Usage events count completed/refused executions per UTC month with a hard
-- idempotency guarantee via UNIQUE (run_id, outcome) so replays never double-count.
