/**
 * Turns an ingested agent batch into the signal specs the agent passthrough produces. A CWS runtime
 * event yields one `agent_runtime` spec (dedup by rule + host + process). Compliance findings are
 * analyzed by the posture regression path because only passed-to-failed transitions become signals.
 * Activity dumps produce nothing. Evidence is a ClickHouse query descriptor — never the rows.
